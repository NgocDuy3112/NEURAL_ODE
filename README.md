# NEURAL_ODE

This is the repository for my final thesis. In this thesis, I'm figuring out how ODE can be used to replace ResNet for Image Recognition task.

The first step of this repository is to check the result of the original paper of ResNet [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) for the CIFAR10 [link](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.
